ipx::merge_project_changes ports [ipx::current_core]

Tasks to Do:

1. Copy over the project files with the block design and the include layout tag 
2. Change all the clocks to the exact same reference which is tclk coming for the adc and the dac
3. Then run the synthesis 
4. Also change the ip folder name to the qick time tagger HS and then copy back the qick peripheral template for Martin

5. The adc reset signals can be combined but not necessary 
6. Slowest Sync Clock for the tproc_rst is just tproc clk

6. Tproc clk just 

time tagger -> fifo -> DMA_ctrl -> AXI_DMA


To-do:
1. Add debug signals to deduce functionality 
    a. State of the time tagger (IDLE, triggered, etc)
    b. Signal on the output of the fifo 
    c. Check arm, read, fifo_out, fifo_empty
    d. The datapath triggered line
    e. Store ready
2. Add a clock domain cross-over for the values going from the tproc to the axi_reg 
    a. DTi 
    b. Status Register (cannot contain infomation that changes on tproc time)
