write_bd_tcl -force /home/mdifeder/bd_216_qt_2022-1.tcl -include_layout

ipx::merge_project_changes ports [ipx::current_core]

Tasks to Do:

1. Copy over the project files with the block design and the include layout tag 
2. Change all the clocks to the exact same reference which is tclk coming for the adc and the dac
3. Then run the synthesis 
4. Also change the ip folder name to the qick time tagger HS and then copy back the qick peripheral template for Martin

5. The adc reset signals can be combined but not necessary 
6. Slowest Sync Clock for the tproc_rst is just tproc clk

6. Tproc clk just 

time tagger -> fifo -> DMA_ctrl -> AXI_DMA


To-do:
Fix the clock domain crossing for the qick time tagger 
1. axi_slv_qp (QP_CFG[7] -> multiplexing signal for the qtt module) 
2. also need to register threshold before sending into the time tagger 


3. Register values from the fifo into a clock crossover register, however doesnt matter
